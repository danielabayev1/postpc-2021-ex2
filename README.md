# answer to hypothetical question ex3:

if we want to add button "x" to run multiplication we will need to add this functionality in the calculator interface
and implement it in simpleCalculatorImp(insertMult method). we will need to change insertEquals,insertMinus/insertPlus(to avoid multiple orders in sequence) methods.
we will need to add a new button in the main_activity.xml and change the mainActivity class to support the functionality of this button.
we can run test in the calculator to check correctness of the logic. tests on the activity to check the new button functionality, and add tests to appFlow
to check this feature in the flow of the app.


# AndroidCalculator - Calculator exercise for Android developers

## In this project:
- Calculator screen with XML ready for portrait and landscape
- Calculator interface used by the Activity
- Unit tests for the calculator and the activity

## Your job:
- Implement `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- add more unit tests to `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- Implement `MainActivity.java`
- add more unit tests to `MainActivityTest.java`
- add more flow tests to `AppFlowTest.java`

Basically look for "TODO" in the code.


Good luck!
